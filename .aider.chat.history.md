I have a game concept called "Rent Wars." It is a 10x10 competitive grid where players buy land, and others can steal it by paying double the current value.

Please write a comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD) that enhances this loop with the following depth:

Economy Balancing: Create a mathematical formula for "Price Decay" so land doesn't become infinitely expensive.

Classes/Roles: Introduce 3 distinct player classes (e.g., The Tycoon, The Saboteur, The Builder) that have unique passive abilities regarding rent or purchase costs.

Visual Progression: Describe how the grid visually changes from "Dirt" to "Cyberpunk Citadel" based on the plot's value.

The "Disaster" Mechanic: Invent a random event system (e.g., Market Crashes, Gentrification) to shake up the board every 60 seconds.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized 10x512 grid of land plots, each plot represented by a pixelated tile. The grid starts as brown dirt tiles and gradually transforms into neon‑lit cyberpunk citadels as plots increase in value. The logo should depict the progression from low‑value dirt to high‑value cyberpunk citadel, with a subtle gradient of colors indicating value. The background should be a dark gradient to emphasize the cyberpunk aesthetic.

#### make it playable not only word  

The following files will most likely need to be edited (or created) to implement the playable “Rent Wars” grid, update the app metadata, and generate the logo:

```
mini-app/app/page.tsx
mini-app/components/grid.tsx   (new file if it does not yet exist)
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
