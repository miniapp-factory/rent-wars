+Code the following app

+I have a game concept called "Rent Wars." It is a 10x10 competitive grid where players buy land, and others can steal it by paying double the current value.
+
+Please write a comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD) that enhances this loop with the following depth:
+
+Economy Balancing: Create a mathematical formula for "Price Decay" so land doesn't become infinitely expensive.
+
+Classes/Roles: Introduce 3 distinct player classes (e.g., The Tycoon, The Saboteur, The Builder) that have unique passive abilities regarding rent or purchase costs.
+
+Visual Progression: Describe how the grid visually changes from "Dirt" to "Cyberpunk Citadel" based on the plot's value.
+
+The "Disaster" Mechanic: Invent a random event system (e.g., Market Crashes, Gentrification) to shake up the board every 60 seconds.

+I have a single-player game concept called "Rent Wars." It is a 10x10 grid strategy game where the Player competes against a ruthless AI opponent to buy land. The core mechanic is that land can be stolen by paying double the current value.
+
+Please write a comprehensive Game Design Document (GDD) that fleshes out this PvC loop with the following details:
+
+AI Logic Archetypes: Define 3 distinct AI "Personalities" (e.g., The Aggressor who instantly steals back, The Slumlord who buys cheap land wide, and The Sniper who waits for price decay). Explain the logic/algorithm they use to decide when to buy.
+
+Economy Balancing (The Decay): Create a mathematical formula for "Price Decay." When a plot is stolen (price doubles), it should slowly decrease over time to prevent the board from locking up.
+
+Player Classes: Introduce 3 distinct classes the player can choose to counter specific AI types (e.g., The Broker has lower buy fees, The Fortifier slows down price decay on their own land, The Saboteur freezes AI assets).
+
+Visual Progression: Describe how the grid visually evolves from "Dirt" to "Cyberpunk Citadel" based on the plot's value/height.
+
+The "Disaster" System: Invent a random event system (e.g., Market Crashes, Gentrification, Earthquakes) that forces both the Player and the AI to pivot strategies every 60 seconds.
+
+Win Conditions: Define how the player beats the computer. Is it a time limit? Bankruptcy? Or controlling 51% of the grid?
+
+What changed from your original prompt?
+AI Archetypes: In PvC, the "fun" comes from predicting the computer. By asking for "Personalities," the GDD will ensure the computer doesn't just play randomly.
+
+Player Classes (Refined): I tweaked the classes to specifically sound like counters to an AI (e.g., "The Fortifier" helps against an aggressive AI).
+
+Win Conditions: In PvP, the game ends when people quit or time runs out. In PvC, you need a specific goal (e.g., "Bankrupt the Bot"), so I added a request for that.
